# Advanced E-Auction Platform Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Alchemy API Block Range Limitation
- **Problem**: The backend was trying to fetch events from block 0 to 'latest', which exceeds Alchemy's free tier limit of 10 blocks.
- **Solution**: Modified the `indexPastEvents()` function to only fetch events from the last 10 blocks, making it compatible with Alchemy's free tier.

### 2. Backend Analytics Initialization
- **Problem**: Analytics initialization was failing and preventing the backend from starting properly.
- **Solution**: Added proper error handling so the backend continues to work even if analytics initialization fails.

## Current Status

✅ **Backend**: Fixed Alchemy API compatibility issues
✅ **Frontend**: MetaMask integration is working correctly (shows proper error when MetaMask is not installed)
✅ **API**: Backend endpoints are properly configured

## Next Steps to Get Your Platform Running

### 1. Install MetaMask Browser Extension
- Download and install MetaMask from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)
- Create a wallet or import an existing one
- Make sure you're connected to the correct network (localhost:8545 for local development)

### 2. Start the Backend
```bash
npm run start:backend
```

### 3. Start the Frontend
```bash
npm run dev:frontend
```

### 4. Start Hardhat Local Network (if using local development)
```bash
npm run hh:node
```

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```env
# For local development
RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8545
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_deployed_contract_address

# For mainnet/testnet (optional)
# RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_API_KEY
# PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_here
```

## Troubleshooting
